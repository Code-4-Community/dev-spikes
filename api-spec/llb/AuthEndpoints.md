# Login and Token Endpoints

#### Common Headers: 
For any request with a body it is assumed that this header exists:
```
  Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Access Token Composition:
``` json
{
    "userId": INT,
    "adminLevel": INT
}

```

- adminLevel: integer describing the user's privilege level. 
    - 0: General Public (GP)
    - 1: Participating Family (PF)
    - 2: Admin


#### Note:

For any protected route, if the access token included in the request header is expired the backend will return a 401 with the following text indicating that a refresh is necessary.
```json
 "Given access token is expired or invalid"
```

# __Protected Routes__

These routes are called by an authenticated user. These routes can only be called with a valid access JWT token specified in the following header.

```
X-Access-Token: JWT-String
```

**These routes all have the prefix `api/v1/protected/`

## `DELETE /user`

Deletes the user that called this route as determined by their access JWT.

This route is only implemented to support testing and does not invalidate user access tokens. This is __not safe__ to be called by the frontend client for this reason.

### __Responses__

##### `200 OK`

The user no longer exists
